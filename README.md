# Mobile-Emergency-Triage

Description:
This is a high-fidelity digital prototyping for a mobile app, which aimulates a 
triage process of sortingpatients based on their need for immediate medical treatment
according to certain guidelines. It enables prioritising patients on the basis of the
severity of their condition to receive medical facilities in a timely manner.

There are commonly three triage labels (R, Y, and G). These include:
1. the red label (R) indicates the immediate priority casualties (Priority 1),
2. the yellow/orange colour (Y) which is used for those who require urgent treatment (Priority 2),
3. the green colour (G) representing delayed priority causalities where patients have minor injuries (Priority 3)

Using this app, first the user (most likely a paramedic or a nurse) needs to sign in with a user name and password (and to create an account if not exists). This process can be skipped by the user.
Then there will be five options to choose from: 1) SEIVE triage, 2) Search by a patient, 3) Search by a triage label (symptom or/and injuries), 4) reports, and 5) the map.

The triage labels are determined using simple rules based on the patientâ€™s physiological data including their pulse, respiratory rate, and whether the patient is breathing and walking. The picture below shows how these parameters and rules are used to make a decision about the triage label. You do not need to include these rules in the application but the four parameters of pulse, respiratory
rate, and whether the patient is breathing and walking should be included. Also, as the output, one
of the triage labels should be displayed.
